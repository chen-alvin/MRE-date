MRE Date Converter

A 4 digit MRE code is an encoded number printed or embossed into MRE boxes, packaging, or individual items to indicate when a MRE was produced. The first number indicates the year of the decade that it was produced in, and the following 3 numbers is the day of the year it was produced. For example, a date code of 5001 of a 2010-2019 production ration indicates it was produced on the 001-st day of 2015, or January 1, 2015. A code of 8365 from 2000-2009 means a production date of December 30, 2008.

Because of the single digit allocated for the year of production, it is unclear whether a code of 8001 means that a MRE was produced in 1988, 1998, 2008, or 2018. However, the MRE has undergone several changes since its introduction in 1983, so MREs vary by decade by packaging and components.
